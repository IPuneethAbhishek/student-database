This is a C program for managing student records using file handling. The program provides a menu-driven interface with various options such as adding a record, deleting a record, modifying a record, generating a mark sheet, searching for a record, displaying all records, and changing the password. The program uses a binary file to store the records.

The program begins with a menu-driven interface, which displays the available options. The user can choose an option by entering the corresponding number. Each option is associated with a specific function.

The add() function is used to add a record to the file. It prompts the user to enter the student's details, such as name, age, roll number, and marks in various subjects. It then calculates the total marks and average marks and writes the record to the file.

The password() function is used to authenticate the user before performing any sensitive operation such as adding, deleting, or modifying a record or changing the password. It reads the password from a text file and compares it with the user input. If the password is correct, the user is allowed to proceed; otherwise, the function is called recursively until the correct password is entered.

The displayAll() function is used to display all the records in the file. It reads each record from the file and prints the details on the screen.

The record() function is used to search for a specific record in the file. It prompts the user to enter the roll number of the student and searches for the record in the file. If the record is found, it is displayed on the screen.

The del() function is used to delete a record from the file. It prompts the user to enter the roll number of the student whose record is to be deleted. It then reads each record from the file and writes it to a temporary file, except for the record to be deleted. After all the records have been read and written to the temporary file, the original file is deleted, and the temporary file is renamed to the original file's name.

The modify() function is used to modify an existing record in the file. It prompts the user to enter the roll number of the student whose record is to be modified. It then reads the record from the file, displays the existing details on the screen, and prompts the user to enter the new details. It then calculates the total marks and average marks and writes the modified record to the file.

The marksheet() function is used to generate a mark sheet for a specific student. It prompts the user to enter the roll number of the student whose mark sheet is to be generated. It then reads the record from the file and calculates the grade and percentage. It then displays the mark sheet on the screen.

The changePassword() function is used to change the password. It prompts the user to enter the old password and then the new password. It then writes the new password to the password file.
